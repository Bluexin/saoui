/**
 * Part of saoui
 * Fired when the SAO UI initialises its player stats retrieval fallback.
 *
 *
 * Temporary, future versions will (attempt to) fix inter-mod compatibilities.
 * Shouldn't be fired by other mods!! (unless you're really sure you know what you're doing)
 *
 *
 * Mods could use this event to get the same reference the SAO UI uses, to use the data however they want.
